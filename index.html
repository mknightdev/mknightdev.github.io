            <h3 class="headers">THE BALL</h3>
              <p>
                This was for my 'Programming for Interaction' unit assignment,
                created in the first semester of my second year.
              </p>
              <p>
                We were given a project that had a ball, platform, and a couple of
                interactable items. The task was to amend the game to make it more
                meaningful and ensuring the user interface was consistent.

                We were given a <span class="highlight">Unity</span> project that had a ball, platform, and a
                couple of interactable items. The task was to amend the game
                using <span class="highlight">C#</span> to make it more meaninguful and ensuring the user
                interface was consistent.

          <h3>A* Path-finding Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
              For my 'Ai Games Programming' unit, I had to create two
              <span class="highlight">C++</span> console-based applications
              demonstrating <span class="highlight">A* path-finding</span> and
              a second algorithm of my choice, which I chose
              <span class="highlight">Genetic algorithm</span> and used them to
              compare against each other.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
              <span class="highlight">Note:</span> The A* path-finding algorithm
              I implemented can find the path, but it isn't the shortest path,
              which is what the algorithm should do. I have plans to revist the project
              to try and get it working as intended.

          <h3>HANGMAN</h3>
            <p>
              This was an 'Introduction to Programming' assignment during my first year of University.
              We had to create the game 'hangman' in a console-based application
              using <span class="highlight">C++</span>.
