    <p style="text-align: center;">Hi! My name is Michael, and I'm a second year Games Software Engineering student 
        at Bournemouth University.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">On this page, you will find my projects I have done throughout University.</p>

            <h3>Game Studio Project</h3>
            <p>Currently working on a group project, creating an FPS roguelike game with two other people.</p>
            <p>A detailed description will be added once the project has been completed. We were tasked to create a game 
                using any desired game engine, which my group had chosen Unity because we all had a lot of experience with
                 it. The game idea and genre was down to us as a group, and once decided, we could start development.</p>

            <h3>The Ball</h3>
            <p>This was for my 'Programming for Interaction' unit assignment, 
                created in the first semester of my second year.</p>

                <p>We were given a project that had a ball, platform, and a couple of interactable items. 
                    The task was to amend the game to make it more meaningful and ensuring the user interface was 
                    consistent. We were given a Unity project that had a ball, platform, and a couple of interactable 
                    items. The task was to amend the game using C# to make it more meaninguful and ensuring the user 
                    interface was consistent.</p>

        <div class="item5">
            <h3>A* Pathfinding</h3>
            <p>For my 'Ai Games Programming' unit, I had to create two C++ console-based applications demonstrating 
                A* path-finding and a second algorithm of my choice, which I chose Genetic algorithm and used them to 
                compare against each other.</p>
            <p>Note: The A* path-finding algorithm I implemented can find the path, but it isn't the shortest path, 
                which is what the algorithm should do. I have plans to revist the project to try and get it working 
                as intended.</p>

            <p>This was an 'Introduction to Programming' assignment during my first year of University.
                We had to create the game 'hangman' in a console-based application using C++.</p>
